These roles are currently not filled or are being done by other employees as an additional task (in the school example, the teacher takes care of everything).The former is guaranteed labour for a short period of time while the latter is more or less long term government employment with associated regular pay. The government has records for the former. Why not try and get the people who avail the social scheme into the semi-skilled employment sector? They are both government managed and the government has the records to identify people that can work in this area. Just something to consider.</p>\n",
