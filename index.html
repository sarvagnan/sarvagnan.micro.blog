I don&rsquo;t want to build a whole messy timeline again. The fact that all feeds are just RSS feeds means that I can create multiple lists and manage them with Feedland or NNW.</p>

			 <p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I wanted to get the new Macbook Air or the 14 inch Macbook Pro. I was gravitating towards the Pro but the image of the two side by side in John Gruber&rsquo;s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/07/the_2022_13-inch_macbook_air">review</a> really sold me on the Air. That difference in thickness is quite stunning.</p>

Much of it is discussed on the most recent episode of the Vergecast, but I love how Lopatto gets angrier and angrier as the article goes on.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.sarvagnan.com/2022/03/20/pinku-to-march.html">Pinku: 2013 to 18 March 2022</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.sarvagnan.com/2022/03/20/pinku-to-march.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-20 14:21:00 &#43;0530">Mar 20, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Pinku came to us in 2014. We had adopted two kittens in 2013; Ginger and Hobbes, abandoned siblings (sister and brother respectively); and we kept them indoors. One day in 2014, we had kept the gate to our house open by mistake and Ginger had wandered downstairs. My mother panicked as neither Ginger nor Hobbes had been outdoors and would not know how to survive. She ran downstairs and saw a cat that looked exactly like Ginger sitting on our compound wall; this turned out to be Pinku. We later found Ginger sitting near the stairs of our house, presumably after exploring the environs. After this incident, Pinku started coming around to our house and we started feeding her as well. Our neighbours do not like pets however and one day my mother returned home and heard that someone had beaten Pinku and scared her off. Hearing my mother calling for her, she came back and we brought her indoors.</p>

<p>After we adopted her and brought her in, Ginger and Hobbes stopped getting along. They had both been neutered but Pinku coming in resulted in a lot of fights between them. Hobbes got along with her swimmingly; Ginger merely tolerated her. She was a skittish cat for the first few years and it seemed as though she did a lot of running and hiding when she was outdoors. Within a few days of us bringing her in, we arranged for her to be spayed and the vet told us that she looked like she had had multiple litters and that she seemed to be about the same age as Ginger and Hobbes. We had three orange cats of about the same age. After Pinku came in, we had more cats coming around. After her, we adopted three more cats with a few more making regular appearances in our terrace or on the compound walls.</p>

<p>From the start, she was the most agreeable of our cats. She&rsquo;d sit alone and come to you for pets when she wanted them. She&rsquo;d scoot underneath blankets and sit in the dark for hours. Unlike Ginger and Hobbes, she was very much the stereotypical cat in many ways, just much more friendly. Ginger and Hobbes needed people around at all times, Pinku was much more comfortable sitting on her own. We had to keep Hobbes and Ginger separate as their confrontations became violent, but Pinku just got along with both of them. One of the lasting memories we have of her is the zoomies she&rsquo;d get when she was done with her morning bathroom duties. My mother would open the bathroom door and Pinku would sprint from one end of the house to the other for ten minutes straight before calming down.</p>

<p>Around September of 2021, she started to have issues with her breathing and we could see that it was very labourious. The vet told us that she had fluid in her chest cavity and that she would need to be medicated in order for it to be drained. We were not able to find a cause for why this happened; it seems that this is not uncommon in cats. From that point on she was on meds and she hated them. Giving her the meds was an undertaking that was full of scratches. It got to the point that Pinku started trying to spit out the medicine even before we had started. Until this month, we thought the condition was something that would remain and that the medicines would keep it under control.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, she started breathing through her mouth and looked uncomfortable. This was something that we had seen on some days, and a checkup had already been scheduled for the afternoon, so we thought that this was something that would need to be highlighted in the checkup. However, at around 4 PM she rapidly deteriorated and passed away within the next half an hour. Her last rites and burial were conducted by a man called Anbu at the pet cemetery in Kannamapettai in Chennai.</p>

<p>We loved Pinku and had 8 years with her. We hope that she was happy in the time that she was here.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 

<p>With all of the hubbub about WhatsApp&rsquo;s new privacy policy, a whole bunch of people switched to Signal. As someone who&rsquo;s been trying to get people to switch to Signal for years (for my own selfish reasons; I&rsquo;ve wanted to try the app but can&rsquo;t do so with just myself), I&rsquo;ve viewed this as a good thing. However, I can&rsquo;t switch apps wholesale as a lot of people I know still use WhatsApp, plus all of my work chats are there. After using both for sometime, here are a few pros and cons I&rsquo;ve found with both.</p>

<h2 id="whatsapp-feature-bloat">WhatsApp: Feature Bloat</h2>

<p>This has been discussed ad nauseum in other places so I&rsquo;ll try to keep this short. There is just too much going on in WhatsApp. I get where Facebook is coming from on this though as I know a lot of people who manage their lives on WhatsApp.</p>

<h2 id="signal-reliability">Signal: Reliability</h2>

<p>Signal seems to have issues with messages actually going through. A friend and I had numerous issues with chats and photos. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why. Which leads me to the next point.</p>

<h2 id="signal-cross-platform-consistency">Signal: Cross-platform consistency</h2>

<p>Signal has apps for all the major platforms. However, actually syncing activity between two different platforms is a different story entirely. They have an explanation for why they don&rsquo;t sync chats on first launch but this doesn&rsquo;t hold water in my opinion. It is entirely possible to have peer to peer syncing between your own clients and based on their privacy stance, this is something that I would have expected them to build. At this stage though, it is left up to chance as to what messages you see where.</p>

<h2 id="signal-the-someone-is-on-signal-notifications">Signal: The &ldquo;Someone is on Signal&rdquo; notifications</h2>

<p>These are just plain annoying. At the start, Signal tells you about everyone in your contacts who is on the app. I would have expected this to be disabled by default at least.</p>

<h2 id="whatsapp-spam">WhatsApp: Spam</h2>

<p>This is probably because there are way more people who use WhatsApp than Signal, but spam is a major issue. I get random messages from people and I have no idea how to prevent this. I don&rsquo;t want it to be impossible for people outside my contacts to reach me and I&rsquo;m not sure how you&rsquo;d get rid of spam without compromising the privacy features of the app. This is a thorny one.</p>

<p>Up until some time ago, I had WhatsApp&rsquo;s inability to make calls from the desktop on this list, but they have since added this.</p>

<p>This is all that comes to mind right now; I&rsquo;ll keep adding to this as more things come up or as some of this is fixed.</p>

			 <p>As a DuckDuckGo user, I don&rsquo;t see much of Google on a day to day basis. However, I found today that they seem to show key moments in YouTube videos even if the video does not have chapters. I&rsquo;m not sure how they&rsquo;re doing this but it is super interesting to see.</p>

			 <p>An idea a friend and I came up with today (most probably others have had this as well). In India, we have a lot of social welfare schemes that employ unskilled people in manual labour. We also require a lot of semi-skilled workers in other settings, like helping staff in schools. These roles are currently not filled or are being done by other employees as an additional task (in the school example, the teacher takes care of everything).The former is guaranteed labour for a short period of time while the latter is more or less long term government employment with associated regular pay. The government has records for the former. Why not try and get the people who avail the social scheme into the semi-skilled employment sector? They are both government managed and the government has the records to identify people that can work in this area. Just something to consider.</p>

			 <p>Spent Saturday night and Sunday drowning out my internal monologue with a movie and two tv shows. This is the first time in a while that I&rsquo;ve actually sat down and binged movies and TV.

<p>Longer Version: Whenever I watch movies of the superhero variety, it seems like they are becoming more and more like games. There&rsquo;s an exploration phase where you build out the story, then you meet the big boss, you have a team, then there is a boss fight. The seams are also readily visible; visualizing the movie as a game, you can tell where the cut scenes would be. Birds of Prey readily fit into this mould.</p>

<p><strong>Fleabag</strong>:</p>

<p>TL;DR: Excellent</p>

<p>Longer Version: If someone asks for the perfect TV show, point them to this. Everything about this is amazing; the humour, each beat, the editing, the storyline. I had this on my watchlist for ages (see aforementioned jadedness) and then spent the day kicking myself for not watching it earlier. A few highlights: the names given to characters, breaking the fourth wall and then breaking that mechanic too, the brokenness of the main character and how that&rsquo;s approached; I could go on and on. Watch this show and revel in its greatness.</p>

<p><strong>Killing Eve</strong>:</p>

<p>TL;DR: S1: Good, S2 &amp; 3: Fluctuates between meh and good</p>

<p>Longer Version: I started watching this because it&rsquo;s in the Phoebe Waller-Bridge universe, and you can see her fingerprints all over season one. The storytelling is tight but there a lot of elements to the plot that seem extraneous. The extraneous parts were multiplied in S2 and S3, with the worst parts of S2 devolving into a buddy cop drama. When it works, it is a great show with the chemistry between the main leads really shining through. When it doesn&rsquo;t work though, it is a slog. I was grateful for the forward skip button at multiple points. Bottom line: watch this if you want more Phoebe Waller-Bridge, just don&rsquo;t expect more Fleabag.</p>

<p>Is there a word or phrase to describe someone who is a fan of the media that the various sports generate rather than the sports themselves?
